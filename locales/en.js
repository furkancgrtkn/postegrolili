Information that you may provide voluntariy Certain parts of our Services may ask you to provide personal information voluntarily. For example, we will ask for certain information in order for you to register for an account with us, to begin using our Services, to subscribe to marketing communications from us, and/or to submit enquiries to us, such as: Contact and correspondence information (such as name and email address); Username and password of your Social media account; Profile information (such as profile photo and biography); and Other data you choose to give us (such as data to identify a lost account).       The personal information that you are asked to provide, and the reasons why you are asked to provide it, we will try to explain to you at the point we ask you to provide your personal information. Where our Services are obtained from Google Play or Apple App Store, we will only use permitted and publicly available information to optimise our Services. We do not publish or disclose non-public contacts or personal information without clear affirmative authorisation to do so.       Information that may be collected automatically When you use our Services, we may also collect data automatically from you and/or your device which may be considered personal information under applicable data protection laws, such as: Data and analytics about your use of our Services; Your IP address and mobile device identifiers (such as your device ID, advertising ID, MAC address, IMEI); Data about your device, such as device name and operating system, browser type and language; Data we collect with cookies and similar technologies; Broad geographic location based on your IP address; Precise geo-location data (GPS, with your consent); and Data about your use of our Services, such as in application interaction and usage metrics.       Advertising ID means Apple Identifier for Advertisers (â€œIDFAâ€) on Apple and Google Advertising Identity (â€œGAIDâ€). These are unique identifiers for mobile device that advertisers use for interest based advertising. They are consistent across all apps and thus allow cross-app tracking. On Apple you can opt-out this by choosing â€œlimit ad trackingâ€ option from privacy settings. On Google Android you can opt-out by choosing â€œOpt-out of interest based adsâ€. Advertising IDs are non-permanent, non-personal identifiers, which are uniquely associated with your device. Similar technologies include tracking pixels within ads. These technologies allow companies (including marketers and advertisers) to recognise your device when you use websites and applications. Data about your device refers to information about your device type, device model, device maker, device operating system and its language or other technical data like screen size or processor, or combination of this data available from a device for a developer for checking the device compatibility with a particular application. Some of this information may be collected using cookies and/or similar technologies (such as 'SDKs' or software development kits), as explained further below. Information that we may obtain from third party sources We may receive personal information about you from third party sources. For example, if you clicked on an advertisement to direct you to one of our Services we may be provided with information from which ad-network and advertising campaign the install originated from.       You may choose to connect to our Services via your social media account. Exactly what information we receive from your social media will depend on your social media privacy settings, but it would typically include your basic public profile information such as: your username; profile picture; age range; and gender The data that we may collect from our partners could include; Data we receive if you link a third-party tool with our Services (such as Facebook, Apple or Google); Demographic data (such as to determine the location of your IP address); Data to fight fraud (such as click fraud in advertising); Data from platforms that our Services run on (such as to verify payment); and Data for advertising and analytics purposes, so we can optimise the Services we deliver to you.
